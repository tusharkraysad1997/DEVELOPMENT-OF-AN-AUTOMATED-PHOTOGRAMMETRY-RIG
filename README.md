# DEVELOPMENT-OF-AN-AUTOMATED-PHOTOGRAMMETRY-RIG
Photogrammetry is a 3D scanning technique in which a set of 2D photos of an object is used to create a virtual model of it. It is the science of making measurements from photographs in which the photogrammetry software measures and collects the matching featured between different photos giving out a virtual 3D model of the object as the result.
The process of photogrammetry is complex and requires expertise to create a 3D scan of the object. It also requires manpower to take photographs manually in 3600. The object is to be well lit in order to obtain good results. The process can also be carried out using multiple cameras, but it increases the cost of the equipment required. To overcome the complexity of the photogrammetry process and to make it simpler for anyone to use it, the process needs to be automated.
The automated photogrammetry rig enables one to use the technology of 3D scanning using photogrammetry at low cost and without any expertise to get high quality 3D scans of various objects which can be applied to numerous fields worldwide.
